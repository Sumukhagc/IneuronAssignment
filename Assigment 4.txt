1. It is an empty list.
2. spam.insert(2,"Hello")
3. d
4. d
5.['a','b']
6. 1
7. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]
8.[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]
9. replication is nothing but creating new list by replicating element of existing list.
   eg. a="Python"
       replica=a*3	
      #value of replica will be "PythonPythonPython"
   concatenation is appending 2 variable 
   eg: a="python" 
       b="code"
       a+b is concatenation it has value "pythoncode"
10. append() is a method used to append values at the end of list
    insert() is method used to insert values in a specified position of a list.

11. using delete() method and using del.
    delete("<value in a list>") we use delete() method by passing value of list as parameter.
    del list[<index>] here we pass index to delete the value.

12. Both String and list are sequence type that is string store sequence of characters.List can store sequence of homogeneous and 
    heterogeneous values.
    Both String and list values we can index and slice to get desired values of string and list.
    Both String and list are mutable i.e we can modify the values.

13. Tuples are immutable i.e we cannot change value once intialised.
    Lists are mutable i.e we can change values of the list.

14. tup=(42,)

15. to get list value in tuple form we use tuple(my_list)
    to get tuple value in list form we use list(my_tuple)

16. Variables that contain list values has the reference to the memory where the list values are present in memory.


17.
 copy.copy() will do a shallow copy. that is new objects are created but the value inside are still referenced to the original list.
so any change made in the copied object will reflect in the original object also.
copy.deepcopy() will do a deep copy. that is new objects are created and all the values are copied 
from the original objects to new object.So any change made in new copy will not make changes in the original copy.
