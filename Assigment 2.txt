1. True and False are 2 values of boolean datatype. 
   We write it like True for value true and False for value false.

2. and or not are the 3 different boolean operators.

3. Truth table for 2 variables.
		
		OR truth table.

	var1		var2		value
	1		1		1
	1		0		1
	0		1		1
	0		0		0

		AND truth table

	var1		var2		value
	1		1		1
	1		0		0
	0		1		0
	0		0		0

		NOT truth table
	var		value
	1		0		
	0		1

4. i.True and False so answer is False
   ii.not(5>4) i.e not(True) so answer is False
   iii. True or False so answer is True
   iv. not(True or False) i.e is not(True) so answer is False.
   v.  True and False so answer is False
   vi. True or False so answer is True.

5. > Greater 
   < Less
   >= Greater than or equal to
   <= Less than or equal to
   == equal to 
   != not equal to

6. For equal to thats is to compare values we use '==' operator. but to assign values we use '=' operator.
   ex: a=10 is an assignment operator
       a==10 is comparison operator.

7. Three blocks of code are
    ham
    spam
    spam

8.
spam =int(input("Enter the number:"))
if(spam ==0):
    print("Hello")
elif(spam==1):
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9. ctrl + C

10. break will come out of loop
    continue will come out of that particular iteration.

11. There is no difference between all three range(10), range(0,10) range(0,10,1) it will print values from 0 to 9.
    first one in general will have values from 0 to n-1
    second one will have values in the given range. ex range(a,b) will have values from a to b-1
    third one will have value in the given range. ex range(a,b,c) will have values between a,b with step value of c.

12. for(i in range(1,11)):
	print(i)

	using while loop
	i=1
	while(i<=10):
           print(i)
           i=i+1

13. spam.bacon()
